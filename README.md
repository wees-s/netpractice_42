## Description

**NetPractice** is a practical project from the 42 school whose goal is to introduce the fundamental concepts of computer networking. The project consists of solving interactive exercises where it is necessary to correctly configure IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways, as well as understand the role of devices such as routers and switches for a network to function properly.

The activity is carried out through a web-based interface that simulates small networks, allowing the student to test and validate their configurations.

## Instructions

### Running the training interface

1. Download the file provided on the NetPractice project page.
2. Extract the files to a directory of your choice.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
4. Enter your 42 login in the designated field to practice with your personal configuration.
5. Solve the levels by adjusting the editable fields until the network works correctly.
6. Use the **Check again** button to validate the configuration.

### Exporting configurations

- After successfully completing each level, use the **Get my config** button to export the corresponding configuration file.
- Export **one file per level** before moving on to the next level.

### Submission

- The project contains **10 levels**, therefore **10 configuration files** must be submitted, **one per level**.
- All exported files must be placed at the **root of the Git repository**.
- Only the files present in the repository will be considered during evaluation.

## Resources

### Networking concepts studied

- **TCP/IP addressing**: assignment of unique IP addresses to each device on the network, allowing host identification and communication.
- **Subnet mask**: used to divide a network into smaller subnets, determining which bits of an IP address represent the network and which represent the hosts.
- **Default gateway**: the router address responsible for forwarding traffic outside the local network when the destination is not in the same subnet.
- **Routers and switches**: network devices responsible, respectively, for routing packets between different networks and interconnecting devices within the same local network.
- **Communication between network devices**: basic principles of data exchange between hosts, respecting addressing and routing rules.
- **OSI model layers**: a conceptual model that divides network communication into layers, making it easier to understand operation and troubleshoot network issues.

### Use of AI

AI was used as a support tool for:
- Clarifying theoretical networking concepts (TCP/IP, subnet mask, and default gateway).
- Assisting in the organization and writing of the project documentation.
